# "Type Or Die" - Disappearing Text Writing App

This is a simple text editor made for writers to help overcome writers block. 
You have to keep on typing. If you stop typing for 10 seconds, the text will get blurry and disappear. 
You can also get a random prompt consisting of two sentences to get you started.
